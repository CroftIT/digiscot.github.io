### Project description

We plan to offer a 3 stage employability programme to help people attain digital skills and the confidence to apply for benefits, jobs and to return to work. We will deliver an open day and 3 stages of 6 days each over 6 weeks. The programmes allow for early positive outcomes and introduction of new people at higher competency levels.

Stage 1 – Introduction to Digital
An introductory programme, aimed at people with limited or no experience of online digital skills. It aims to introduce them to computers in a non-threatening way, develop confidence in basic operations and help them get online safely. It will include the British Computer Society “Computer and Online Basics” course and other employability skills. Through these skills we will ensure people have a basic grasp of Universal Jobmatch and can register and search for jobs through this system. Each candidate will be given an exit interview and action plan, with access to ongoing support, to ensure their progress continues.
The outcomes from this stage will include
•	Completion of BCS Computer and Online Basics
•	Increase in confidence of Digital Skills
•	Introduction to and registration and setting up a profile on Universal Jobmatch

Stage 2 – Digital Applications
Stage 2 is aimed at people with a basic knowledge of computers and website use, but limited experience of online job search. The course will provide a progressive programme to advance people’s digital skills. It will include ensuring all aspects of Universal Jobmatch are being used, an introduction to My World of Work and CV Building. The skills introduced will include drafting covering letters in online packages and through Microsoft Office. It will cover setting up email accounts, monitoring the account and attaching documents to emails
The outcomes from this stage will include
•	Using all features of Universal Jobmatch
•	Increase in confidence in use of job search websites and applying online
•	1 supported application (Real or Simulated)

Stage 3 – Selling yourself – Beyond the digital
Stage 3 provides dedicated support for people to use digital skills to apply for positions and attend interviews.
It will assist people to develop their digital skills to apply for positions. The process will start with job search and identification of suitable posts, followed by drafting suitable applications and preparing for interviews. We will use business contacts to provide mock interviews and realistic feedback. We will also support evaluation at the end of the process to encourage learning and therefore greater success with future applications.
The outcomes from this stage will include
•	Increased knowledge of a process for applying for positions
•	Reduced stress at job interviews
•	4 job applications completed (Real or Simulated)

All participants will be offered 2 weeks aftercare support including access to the ICT suite for a minimum of 1 hour per week, proof reading and individual support for applications.

### Planned project milestones

* Programme planned and advertised; we will have developed the programme plan, have prepared programme content and be ready to deliver. In addition we will have met partners to advertise the programme to participants, have developed marketing material and distributed it to all partners. Bookings for places at the open day will be open: January 2015

* Open day held: we will have held the open day detailing the programme to potential participants, have evaluated all attendees skills and signposted them to the most appropriate course. We will have selected the people to start the course, with backups should they choose not to participate.

* 3 stages delivered; we will have delivered the three stages of the course, assisted people to gain the BCS Computer and Online Basics certificate and gain skills toward employability. We will have collected pre and post course evaluation, held exit interviews and helped people plan their next steps.

* Programme Evaluation completed; we will have collated all evaluation information, assessed results and made written recommendations for future programmes.
