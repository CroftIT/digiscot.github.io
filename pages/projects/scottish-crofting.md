### Project description

The Croft IT project aims to reach out to crofters and smallholders of all ages in crofting areas throughout the Highland and Islands to bring them up to speed in the use of IT for everyday life. Historically, uptake and willingness to use on line services has been poor within the crofting sector. The advent of the 2015 Scottish Rural Development Programme has necessitated an increased demand for IT and digital coaching to help crofters and smallholders access agriculture support schemes and other services. The crofting area comprise of - Shetland, Orkney, Isle of Lewis, Isle of Harris, North Usit, Benbecula, South Uist, Eriskay, Isle of Barra, the small Isles, Isle of Mull, Isle of Bute, Isle of Skye, Isle of Arran, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross and Cromarty, Invernesshire, Argyll, Nairnshire and Morayshire. The majority of these areas are characterised by remoteness, rurality and isolation of population therefore the use of digital technology is essential for enhancing communication channels, knowledge transfer and bringing the world to their doorstep. Training events will be promoted by Local Course Directors and held in local Village Hall, Community Centres etc. The Scottish Crofting Federation is a charitable company which aims to:-

* Develop, promote and support crofting livelihoods as a unique social system unified through small-scale food production; 
 
* Represents and safeguards the interests of crofters, their communities, their cultural heritage, their moral and legislative rights; 
 
* Promotes the agricultural, social and environmental benefits of crofting as intrinsic to the development and maintenance of local rural economies; 

* Raises awareness of crofting through information provision and education; 

* Promotes diversity and economic viability within crofting; 

* Encourages, through training, crofting enterprise, skills and expertise; 

* Is led by its membership in developing position on policy matters and works always using participative methodology; 

* Seeks the development of crofting as an important and valuable way of life. 

SCF Training Team will be responsible for running the project. With support from the fund we aim to purchase 15 Ipad Air devices with tough cases to support outdoor and classroom based learning. 

The Ipad devices will be used to support digital inclusion amongst the crofting community and enable trainees to fully engage with data entry and capture for crofting. In addition the devices will also be used as teaching aids to foster apps relevant to crofting for example: the Hutton institute soil profiling app, cattle tag apps and digital mapping apps using GPS for croft mapping exercises. In terms of innovation, the project aims to promote the use if IT and digital inclusion in crofting communities, some of which have never engaged with IT in this way before. We hope to build skills and capacity to inspire people and and improve digital uptake.

### Planned project milestones

* Purchase 15 Ipad Air 2 with Cases, Insurance and Charging Dock : January 2016

* Development time required to integrate digital inclusion into training programme: January/February 2016

* Run in-house staff training day for Local Course Directors and Tutors at two possible locations: May 2016

* It is hoped the main training programme will begin in July 2016 and during the lead up to the the hardware will be used at SCF Events, Crofters Meetings and small networking sessions.

* Evaluation of Croft IT project within SCF Training Programme to ensure IT training becomes a keystone of succeeding years within the Training Programme. During 2016 - 2019 we aim to support a further 1,500 Service Users: October 2016


### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Social - reduce isolation throughout crofting areas across the Highlands and Islands via IT knowledge transfer.and resultant digital inclusion.

* Environmental - reduce individualsâ€™ carbon footprint by introducing IT and demonstrating how on-line services can accessed therefore reducing the need for paper applications, travel etc.

* Economic - promote digital inclusion to enhance skills and opportunities for crofters and smallholders to work remotely.
