### Project description

The project will be run by Rosemount Lifelong Learning. Rosemount delivers a range of learning opportunities, pre employability support for families and childcare from our two centres based in Royston. The project will complement other community based learning opportunities we offer by delivering digital skills for people don’t speak English as their first language in North East Glasgow. North East Glasgow has a high level of people living within the community who are speakers of other languages. We will recruit a new small team of volunteers who speak a range of different languages in addition to English to deliver digital skills training. These volunteers will be trained to deliver digital skills on a 1:1 or small group basis to people who speak the same language. This will enable people with no or low digital skills to initially concentrate on learning one set of skills at a time – digital skills. Over time and as the participants digital skills increase the volunteers will be able to teach the people they are matched with the necessary technical language in English so that they will be able to use computers, keyboards and internet that are available in Scotland for use without specialist adaption and settings. The 1:1 or small group nature of the support will allow people to have a high level of individualised support and to learn at their own pace and focus on developing the digital skills they identify that they need. Currently we are unable to offer IT learning to speakers of other languages unless they have a good level of spoken written and read English which is excluding many people from digital learning. We currently use volunteer literacy tutors to deliver 1:1 literacy work and small group with local people and aim to expand this model to the new area of deliver digital skills to people whose first language is not English.

We will recruit a part time volunteer coordinator who will recruit and train volunteers who have speak range languages. It would be impossible to recruit volunteers that speak every language in the area but will focus on the most widely spoken languages in the area. The Volunteer Coordinator will also match people looking for support with digital skills with volunteers and offer volunteers ongoing support and training and develop the project. We will also look at how these volunteers can support our existing ESOL classes by doing digital skills inputs into classes and working alongside class tutors.

Participants will be able to choose which device(s) they use to learn with including desktops, laptops, tablets and phones. They will also be taught about the range of devices that are available. The project is innovative as it doesn’t require participants to increase their level of English language before they are able to learn digital skills and also separates out the two skills of English and Digital skills as well later combining the learning of the two.
