### Project description

The project will aim to increase digital inclusion within the visually impaired people of East Lothian ensuring they are able to play a part in the life of their communities. This will be achieved through very small classes consisting of the visually impaired person and their partner/carer and the tutor. The tutor in this case will be Jane McWhirter, Assitant Customer Service Officer in Wallyford Library. Jane is a qualified teacher with a natural passion and flair for ICT. 

The classes will be held in Wallyford Library when it is closed so Jane can give her full attention to her students. Wallyford has very good transport links to the rest of the county with a train station and frequent bus service. The 6 mini IPads bought from a previous bid will be used or if the student prefers they will use their own device. Jane has led a few classes previously and from experience knows that 2 people per class is sufficient and necessary for the most to be gained by participants. 

It is envisaged that classes will take place weekly and a session will last for 3 hours. Each student will receive 6 sessions in total or less dependent on need.

### Planned project milestones

* Advertise for students - in libraries via posters and social media. Also contact residents known to the equalities officer and via the Messenger newspaper: December 2015

* Classes will begin with the first 2 students: January 2016
* Classes completed for group 3: May 2016
* Classes are completed for group 7: October 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* People with visual impairments are less isolated and better connected to their communities through digital technology
* East Lothian Council delivers better services to people with visual impairment across the county. So implementing the East Lothian Digital Inclusion and Participation Strategy
* East Lothian Library Service increases membership and issues of resources e.g. Books on CD, eaudio books
* Visually impaired people gain independence through use of online technology

### Evaluation

Due to unforeseen circumstances our first session did not begin until the 7th of March, 2 months behind schedule! However, Jane steamed ahead and started the second pair of learners 2 weeks later on the 21st of March. This proved successful with the pairs learning from each other. Group 3 began sessions on the 9th of May and completed on the 20th of June. Next to start were Mr and Mrs Young (group 4) on the 13th of June, again experiencing a slight rollover with the previous learners. Their sessions ended on the 18th of
July.

Our next learner, Freda, involved a little more staff time and organisation. Freda is well known to staff as a regular library user in
Musselburgh. Staff persuaded Freda that the classes would be beneficial to her as rather than being limited to listening to books on CD she would be able to widen her reading choice by downloading e-audiobooks (once Jane had shown her how!). Freda appreciated this but was unhappy about travelling to Wallyford on her own as she is completely blind.  Partnership working provided a solution to the problem. The local Rotary Club were approached and they offered to take Freda to and from her class. We were so glad we found this solution as Freda has come on in leaps and bounds and she is much more confident with technology. Freda finished her classes on the 3rd of October but is hoping to come back in the New Year for further sessions.

Group 6 started classes, another husband and wife, on the 31st of October while Group 7 began on the 28th of November. Both groups
will continue into the New Year. The project was expected to end in November. However, due to Jane being paid at her Assistant Customer Services Officer rate (£11.72) rather than the adult education tutor rate that was applied for (£18) there was money left in the grant for extra classes to run. So rather than the 7 classes set out in the project milestones double this number should actually be achievable.

### Lessons learned

One lesson learned early on was that time scales do slip. Staff and students can be ill, they take holidays etc. However, being flexible
and working around people has ensured the project has remained on track with happy learners as a result.

Working with a visually impaired person and their partner has also been very successful. The partner learns at the classes and is then
able to assist at home enabling more practice between classes.
