### Project description

The project will provide a platform for females from the Black and ethnic minority communities to come together in a spirit of community and learning to access basic IT skills (our aim is to have a sustainable project and as such in year two we aim to additionally offer an intermediate IT course). Given that many of our service users have never used a desk top a laptop or a tablet, it is necessary to first make individuals familiar with the hardware and allow them to feel comfortable around the equipment. It is vital to create a comfortable environment where individuals are not only attending to learn but attending to make friends and contacts who will become their external support networks. Support networks can prove vital in helping to support and encourage the educational progression of individuals and can lead to enhanced computer literacy skills, as often individuals will take their learning home, share their learning and therefore independently expand their learning.

By virtue of the project individuals will learn the skills to set up social network accounts and thereby stay in touch with family and friends via Skype, Facebook, Twitter and others. Through our other projects we have learnt that some of our female service users who, for example have had to leave their loved ones behind and seek refuge or asylum in this country, often are devoid of any support whether that be financial or otherwise and as such may not have access to resources which enables them to stay in touch with their loved ones. This adds to their sense of isolation and exclusion in a country in which they know and have very little and this can and does can affect their mental and physical health. Therefore, the ability to connect with loved ones not only breaks their sense of isolation/exclusion but can help improve their physical and mental well being which is essential to their effective integration in societal life and in them exercising active citizenship.

Participants will learn to surf the net, to access educational websites; health websites; to type in and learn of what is happening locally so they can attend events and meet people. Additionally individuals will be encouraged and supported in making online applications for i.e. benefits; colleges; employment opportunities. They will be introduced to Microsoft word and will be taught how to write a document- save a document and print a document etc.

Emails are an instant and effective way of communication and participants will be assisted in creating email accounts, managing emails and will be encouraged to regularly email other participants to the project in order to build their confidence in communicating in this way.

Through the project our aim is not only to provide and develop Digital skills and experiences but itâ€™s also to encourage excluded individuals and communities to access and benefit from educational, employment and training opportunities that will help break their sense of isolation and exclusion.

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* The key achievement will be the increased digital participation and engagement of females from the Black and ethnic cultural communities that will result in them developing enhanced computer literacy skills. This is important considering these individuals may not otherwise have access to the resources which will be made possible and available through the project.
* 50 disadvantaged females will have learnt and developed their IT skills
* Participants will be using emails and social media as an effective means of communication to stay connected with family and friends
* IT skills will be transferred to family members and friends
