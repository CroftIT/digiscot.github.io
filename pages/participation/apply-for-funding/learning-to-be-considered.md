## Learning to be considered

In developing applications for the Fund, it is important that organisations build on evidence around digital participation and lessons learned from previous projects:

{:.browser-default}
* Those without basic digital skills are more likely to be older, on lower incomes and facing other forms of inequality. Applicants should therefore clearly focus on tackling exclusion and highlight the inequalities facing current client groups.
* Half of those that don't have basic digital skills want to acquire them. The other half can be convinced, but the key is finding a &#39;hook&#39;. This needs to be about understanding how the internet can help support personal interests and passions of individuals. Previous &#39;hooks&#39; have ranged from history to crafts to tropical fish. Applicants should articulate whether they are focusing on those who do want to acquire skills and/or how they will stimulate the interest and motivation for individuals to develop basic digital skills
* Access to internet connections and devices are an important part of digital participation. However, the motivation to go online, understanding of its benefits and the skills to do so are often more significant issues than access. Therefore, while some support may be available for connectivity and devices, the focus should be on building confidence and skills.
* More low-income households now are accessing the internet by smartphones only, potentially without fixed line broadband connections. Evidence shows that smartphones can help people get online, but only enable people to access a limited range of the benefits of the internet. Smartphone-only users still need access to other devices and support to develop basic digital skills. We would welcome some applications which explored this issue in more detail, building on [recent Ofcom research](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/telecoms-research/smartphone-by-default-2016).  We are specifically looking to support a small number of projects which can generate further evidence on the extent to which mobile-only internet use can contribute to the development of basic digital skills.
* The delivery of direct basic digital skills training activity, delivered by dedicated paid members of staff or volunteers, has cost between £50 and £300 per person supported. The higher end costs have been where an individual has complex requirements to enable them to get online.  Some of the most successful and sustainable interventions have been where digital skills motivation and support is embedded within core activity. We would particularly welcome applications which focus on embedding digital skills through in core activity through this &#39;digital champion&#39; approach to ensure sustainability of activity.

Additional learning from previous Challenge Fund projects, which may be relevant, includes:

{:.browser-default}
* People needed a greater number of shorter sessions to develop their basic digital skills, rather than shorter, more intense training.
* People needed more 1-2-1 support than originally envisaged in project applications.
* More people had their own devices than originally thought, but did not have the skills to use them.
* Everyone learning on the same type of device was often more productive than methods using different devices.
* For some projects, overcoming basic literacy and language barriers took longer than anticipated, before tackling basic digital skills.
* Choosing the right type of device to fit the activity is crucial. For example, only desktops or laptops are suitable for developing transactional skills (e.g. form filling).
* Some learners emerged as peer volunteers or supporters and this enhanced success significantly.
