## Context

We're working with the definition of [basic digital skills](/participation/basic-digital-skills/) developed by Go ON UK. This highlights five key skills with a safety element underpinning them:

* Communicating
* Transacting
* Managing Info
* Problem Solving
* Creating

Basic digital skills are the starting point on a pathway and identify the foundations that everyone needs to be able to use the internet effectively. Building these skills across Scotland&#39;s communities has the potential to make a significant contributing in tackling exclusion and inequality.

[Recent research](http://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/carnegieuktrust/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2016/09/v3-2697-CUKT-Digital-Participation-summary.pdf) by the Carnegie UK Trust provides evidence on why this is important, noting that many of the groups who are currently digitally excluded could benefit disproportionality from the benefits of being online. The research recognises that while the internet and digital technology is a great enabling and empowering force, if individuals do not have the relevant access, confidence or skills, it has the potential to further exacerbate existing, deep-rooted inequalities.

The recently published Scottish Government [Fairer Scotland Action Plan](http://www.fairer.scot) also highlights the contribution digital participation can make in tackling the &#39;poverty premium&#39;. This is shorthand for the fact that lower income households often have to pay higher prices for basic necessities like gas, electricity and banking than better-off families.

A priority action within the Plan is to ensure _&quot;that low-income consumers have access to the goods and services that enable them to avoid the poverty premium, such as affordable internet access and the digital skills and confidence to transact online to facilitate switching.&quot;_

The Digital Participation Charter Fund is aiming to support organisations to contribute to building basic digital skills as part of broader work to tackle issues of poverty and inequality.
