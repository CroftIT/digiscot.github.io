## FAQ and guidance notes

### 1. When is the deadline?
We will stop accepting application forms on **12th January**. We will not be able to accept applications after this deadline - please leave plenty of time to fill in the form as we'd hate you to miss out.

### 2. What questions will I be asked?
You'll be asked to answer the following questions. If you feel supporting information is required to further evidence your project idea this can be emailed separately, with your Organisation and Project Name as the reference, to [digital@scvo.org.uk](mailto:digital@scvo.org.uk) following the submission of your application.  However, the application will be assessed primarily on the application form.  You should make sure that every piece of information you would like considered as part of your application is within the form.

#### About your project
In the next set of questions we’d like you to tell us more about your specific project idea.  The majority of the questions have a word limit, it might be helpful if you draft text in word (or similar) before pasting your final crafted answer.  There is a word count indicator under each question for guidance.

{:.browser-default}

* **Project Detail** – We'd like to get a clear understanding of your project.  Please explain your proposal and how it will support people who don’t have Basic Digital Skills.  Think about things such as (but not limited to); who are you supporting, who will be running the project, what type of activities you will be doing to support people’s learning and what devices will be used (if any) (N.B. There is a 300 word limit for this answer – you might like to refine your answer in word (or similar first)

Please use this space to tell us how you will embed this digital skills activity in to your work? (N.B. There is a 400 word limit for this answer)
* **Number of people supported** – how many people will be supported to gain basic digital skills?
* **Measuring progress** – Please explain how you will measure the progress and the number of people you are supporting.  You will be required to ensure that each learner completed a Basic Digital Skills questionnaire at the beginning and end of their learning (we will make this available to you) (N.B. There is a 300 word limit for this answer)

### 3. Digital Participation Charter
We're inviting organisations across Scotland to join a national movement to promote digital participation and basic digital skills.  By undertaking work as part of the Charter Fund you will be expected to sign the Charter. You can read more on the [Charter here](http://charter.scvo.org.uk).

### 4. Can I save my application?
Yes, at the top of the application form (from the second page onwards) there is a grey “Save & Continue” button. One clicked this will generate an email to your given contact address with a personalised application link which, when clicked or copied into your browser, will take you straight back in to where you left off.

### 5. Can I move backwards and forwards within the application form?
Yes, however, in order to move forwards you do need to add in a small amount of holding text.  This text is draft until you press the final submit button and can be edited as often as you like.

### 6. Who is eligible to apply?
The Charter Fund is open to groups and organisations from all sectors. We are particularly interested in supporting groups that work closely with their local community. Applicants must operate in Scotland, with awarded funds being spent entirely in Scotland.

### 7. Are there any preferred target groups?
There are three specific key target groups that we are looking to target through the Charter Fund, these are:

{:.browser-default}
* Older people
* Disabled people
* Job Seekers

### 8. Can I submit an application in partnership with another organisation?
Of course. We love seeing organisations working together so please feel free to submit a partnership application. The only thing we ask is that one of the organisations is specified as the lead for the duration of the project; they will be the contract holder and take responsibility for the award.

### 9. Can we submit more than one application?
Yes, we will accept more than one application form where several discrete support activities are being proposed and they are not dependent on one another.

### 9. Can we submit an application if we have already had a project funded under the Digital Participation Challenge?
Yes, however, the activity which you are now asking to be funded must not be continuation funding of that previous project.

### 10. How will my application be assessed?
After the deadline has passed, all applications will be allocated to a member of the assessing group made up of members of the SCVO team; a random group of applications will be selected for peer review. We will then hold a meeting where all of the projects / applications deemed suitable will be discussed and a final set of recommended projects will be agreed upon. The team's recommendations are then considered by the [SCVO Leadership Group which](/about/board/) has the final approval. We aim to announce our final decisions w/c 6th February 2017.
