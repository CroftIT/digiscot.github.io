# Github

The SCVO Digital website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com) which is basically a service that lets you host some project files and many people work on them in tandem, keeping track of any changes. It is called a Version Control System (VCS). One of the benefits for using Github is that you can turn a project repository (or repo) into a website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

You don't need to know the technical details of how Github Pages works to contribute to a website but it can seem a little tricky if you've never used it before. Here is a brief guide that will hopefully de-mystify things for you.

# The steps

## 1. Creating an account

To create an account you will need to open your favourite web browser and navigate to the [main page of Github.com](https://github.com). Once there you should see a screen that looks something like this.
