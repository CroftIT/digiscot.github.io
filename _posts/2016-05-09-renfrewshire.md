**Lauren Gilmour attended Making Digital Everyday training in Paisley on 22nd March 2016.**

I like to think of myself as a bit of a know-it-all when it comes to [basic digital skills](https://www.go-on.co.uk/get-involved/basic-digital-skills/). I'm that person downloading the latest app and finding the newest digital tools in order to do my job more effectively but as the saying goes, “you learn something new every day“. [One Digital](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/onedigital/) training was particularly useful for me because a large part of my new role as Digital Volunteer Co-ordinator, in partnership with [Renfrewshire Council](https://twitter.com/RenCouncilNews), will be to transfer digital skills to as many people as possible.

Overall, I found the Making Digital Everyday training extremely helpful as it gave me the confidence to pass my skills to others. This is perfect as over the next few months I'll be coordinating a team of volunteers with varying levels of digital abilities – from those with degrees in computing to those who simply have a passing interest in computers.

Now that I've had the training, I'll be able to determine the digital skills level of our volunteers by using an [audit](https://www.go-on.co.uk/get-involved/basic-digital-skills/) and looking at the range of [learning behaviours](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/vak-learning-styles.htm). During our session, we carried out a variety of activities that kept us all engaged, including group discussion, problem solving scenarios and putting our new found knowledge into practice.

It was also a great opportunity to meet people from across Renfrewshire who work for a variety of different organisations. Networking is often a big part of training courses but we all felt like we knew each other and there was a really positive atmosphere in the room. I got a sense of how other organisations used [ICT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology) and the gaps that they had in their knowledge.

In terms of the wider digital participation agenda, it is great to see that we are finally getting serious about digital within our organisations, given that [58% of charities across Britain lack basic digital skills](https://resources.lloydsbank.com/insight/uk-business-digital-index/). One of the key messages that I took from the training is that people would like to see additional training on specific tools like [Canva](https://www.canva.com) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) in order to do their job in the digital age. In order to help our service users and increase the number of people participating in the digital age, we need to have confidence in our own skills and abilities.

With the information and resources we were given on the day, I am confident that everyone will become as much of a know-it-all as I am!
