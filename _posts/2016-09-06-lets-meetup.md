I’ve done it too. You attend a digital training session or a really inspiring technology conference and leave with a notebook packed with scribbles of new ideas and a bag full business cards from people you promised to keep in touch with. You get back to the office next day and after five minutes the e-mails about the leaking loo and the ‘meeting about a possible meeting you may get invited to attend’ soon dent your enthusiasm to shake up the way your charity uses digital technology.

You’d really prefer to get together with the people you met at the event on a regular basis. To learn new tricks about using video to capture good news stories, to swap stories about how Pokémon Go has increased the number of young people visiting the community café, or to hear about the latest apps being used by people with Dementia in local care homes. 

The [One Digital](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/onedigital/) team had just the same thought, so when we met up a couple of months ago to talk about the project - a partnership between SCVO and a network of 32 TSIs & local anchor organisations across Scotland - the idea of growing this network further with Meetups using the NetSquared model seemed like just the right solution. [NetSquared](http://www.netsquared.org/about) is a project of [TechSoup](http://meet.techsoup.org/about-us/) which is a global non-profit organisation equipping charities and NGOs in every corner of the world with the technology and guidance they need to fulfil their mission. In Scotland they make software available at hugely discounted rates to registered charities through the [Technology Trust](https://www.tt-exchange.org/).

My role as a volunteer for NetSquared is to develop this network of face to face recurring groups in the [UK and across Europe](http://www.netsquared.org/local?field_geofield_distance%5Bdistance%5D=3000&field_geofield_distance%5Borigin%5D=edinburgh) who meet regularly to learn and share about best use of technology for social change in charities. In the last 12 months 825 meet ups took place in 72 locations reaching 12,943 people. Some of these go by the title of NetSquared, others as a part of existing work as is the case in Scotland.

So on 1st September the first in a series of eight One Digital Meetups took place in Stirling attended by a cross section of 19 charities, digital trainers, carers and a housing association. This cross section is unique to these meet ups and is replicated globally where charities seeking to learn more about digital tools meet at the common intersection with digital agencies and creative start-ups who are looking to direct their skills to helping charities. A true Technology For Good partnership. 


I found the session very rewarding. Some tweets and the presentations are recorded in [Beth Murphy’s Storify](https://storify.com/Betty_Murphy/one-digital-meetup-stirling) and there are other photos on the One Digital [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/One-Digital-Meetup/). Making use of digital tools by charities doesn’t have to be expensive or scary, points which Stirling guest speakers Ross McCulloch & Rebecca Curtis-Moss made in their talks. For me the best part was the sharing session at the end where in 30 minutes we were able to help one organisation think about setting up a Facebook page and set out a strategic social media plan for another charity.

If you’d like to attend a meet up, they are free and taking place across Scotland in September, with others later in the year.
